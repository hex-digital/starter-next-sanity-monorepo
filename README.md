# Next 13 + SanityCMS Monorepo Template

This starter will set you up with a Next 13 app, using app router, and an embedded Sanity studio.

The studio comes with:

- Sensible content defaults (e.g. main nav, footer)
- Live Previews using the latest Sanity live-preview module and Perspectives
- The ability to create multiple navs and footer menus, then choose which is currently active
- Out-of-the-box support for singletons
- Structure for sanity-desk menu to support complex sites
- A monorepo architecture to separate dependencies for studio
